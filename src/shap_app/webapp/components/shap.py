    A decorator for caching resources in Streamlit applications with type

    This function is a wrapper around Streamlit's cache_resource function,

    ensuring that the cached resources are of the correct type.

    Parameters
    ----------
    func : Callable[..., Any]

        The SHAP library is a Python library that allows us to explain

        game theory. The library is model agnostic, meaning it can be used
        to explain any model.
