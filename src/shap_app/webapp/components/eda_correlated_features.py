        ## Bivariate Analysis of Correlated Features

        We can use a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between two
        features. This helps us understand how the features are related to each
        other and whether there is a linear relationship between the features.

        First, we will identify features that have a correlation value above a
        specified threshold with respect to the target column. We will use 0.5
        as the threshold. This means that we will identify features that have a
        correlation value (absolute) greater than 0.5. We will then use these
        features to create a scatter plot matrix.

            The scatter plot matrix provides a comprehensive view of the

            correlation value greater than 0.5 with the target column. This

            these correlations is crucial for predictive modeling, as features
            with high correlation to the target variable are often good

        This figure presents a series of regression plots that explore the

         acres), NOX (nitric oxide concentration), PTRATIO (pupil-teacher
         ratio), RM (average number of rooms), TAX (property tax rate),
         DIS (weighted distances to employment centers), and AGE (proportion of
         owner-occupied units built prior to 1940)—and the Median Home Value
         (TARGET).

         The features have been scaled using Min-Max scaling for
         better comparability. Each subplot provides a linear regression fit to
         indicate the trend between the feature and the target.
