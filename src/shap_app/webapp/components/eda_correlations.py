        ### Correlation Analysis

        Correlation analysis is a statistical method used to evaluate the
        strength and direction of the relationship between two variables.
        The correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1. A value close to 1
        implies a strong positive relationship, a value close to -1 implies
        a strong negative relationship, and a value close to 0 implies no
        relationship.

        By examining the correlation between the target variable and each
        feature, we can identify which features are most likely to influence
        the target variable. This can be particularly useful in feature
        selection for our predictive model.

        Data Science involves the formulation of certain assumptions and
        hypotheses about the dataset, which are then empirically tested through
        various analytical procedures.

            #### What is Pearson Correlation?

            Pearson correlation is a statistical measure that quantifies the
            linear relationship between two variables. It ranges from -1 to 1,
            where:

            - -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation
            - 0 indicates no correlation
            - 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation

            #### What is a Heatmap?

            A heatmap is a graphical representation of data where individual
            values are represented as colors. It's often used to visualize
            complex data structures, such as matrices, to make them easier to
            understand.

            #### What Does a Pearson Correlation Heatmap Show?

            A Pearson correlation heatmap shows the Pearson correlation
            coefficients between multiple variables in a dataset. Each cell in
            the heatmap corresponds to the Pearson correlation coefficient
            between two variables. The color of the cell indicates the strength
            and direction of the correlation:

            - Dark blue for strong negative correlation
            - Light colors for weak correlation
            - Dark red for strong positive correlation

            1.  **Diagonal Line**: The diagonal line from the top-left to the
                bottom-right will always be colored with the strongest positive
                correlation (usually dark red) because any variable is
                perfectly correlated with itself.

            2.  **Symmetry**: The heatmap is symmetrical along the diagonal
                line, meaning the correlation between variable A and variable B
                is the same as between variable B and variable A.

            3.  **Strength and Direction**: The color intensity and hue give
                you a quick visual understanding of the relationship between
                variables. Darker colors signify stronger correlations.

            4.  **Identifying Multicollinearity**: If two independent variables
                are highly correlated (either positively or negatively), it may
                indicate multicollinearity, which could be problematic in some
                models like linear regression.

            5.  **Target Variable**: If you include the target variable in the
                heatmap, you can quickly identify which features are most
                correlated with the target, aiding in feature selection.

        Based on an initial examination of the
        dataset, we can form the following relationships for the following
        features:

        - The 'RM' feature, representing the average number of rooms per dwelling,
          is likely to exhibit a direct correlation with the housing price. The
          rationale behind this assumption is that larger houses, characterized
          by a higher number of rooms, typically accommodate more individuals
          and are generally priced higher due to increased demand. Hence, 'RM'
          and housing prices are hypothesized to be directly proportional.

        - The 'LSTAT' feature, indicating the percentage of lower status
          population, is hypothesized to have an inverse relationship with the
          housing price. The underlying premise is that neighborhoods with a
          higher proportion of lower status population are likely to have lower
          purchasing power, which in turn, could lead to lower housing prices.
          Thus, 'LSTAT' and housing prices are expected to be inversely proportional.

        - The 'PTRATIO' feature, denoting the pupil-teacher ratio, is also
          anticipated to be inversely proportional to the housing price. A
          higher pupil-teacher ratio might suggest a lower number of schools
          in the neighborhood, possibly due to lower tax income. This could be
          indicative of lower average income in the neighborhood, which could
          potentially lead to lower housing prices. Therefore, 'PTRATIO' and
          housing prices are hypothesized to be inversely proportional.
